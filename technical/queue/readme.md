# Queue

A queue data structure is a structure that contains a sequential list of elements. Queues can be FIFO (first in first out) and/or LIFO (last in first out), meaning that you can use them as list to remove or insert objects at either end of the sequence, depending on implementation.

Queues can be space efficient data structures for cases where pushing and popping from both ends of a sequential data structures is needed and the Datum stored is typically large compared the overhead of pointers within nodes.

Implement a Queue data structure that supports the following methods:

```
Queue:
  void push_front(elt)
  void push_back(elt)
  elt pop_front()
  elt pop_back()
  bool empty()
```
